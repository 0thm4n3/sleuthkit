REQUIREMENTS
=============================================================================
Tested Platform:
- Linux 2.*
- Mac OS X
- Windows

Build System:
- C/C++ compiler
- GNU Make
- GNU autoconf, automake, and libtool


Required Libraries:
The following libraries must be installed before building and install the framework.

- POCO: POCO is a set of open source C++ classes for building portable applications. 
The Sleuth Kit framework uses POCO to handle some basic internal tasks.  
Testing has been performed with version 1.4.4 of the POCO libraries.
    Available at http://www.pocoproject.org

INSTALLATION
=============================================================================

Refer to the BUILDING.txt file in the msvcpp directory for details on building using 
Microsoft Visual Studio 2010.

Before you compile the framework, ensure that you have downloaded
all of the modules. The modules are loaded as git Submodules. Use the
following commands to download all of the modules before compiling:

% git submodule init
% git submodule update

The Sleuth Kit framework uses the GNU autotools for building and installation.
There are a few steps to this process.  First, run the 'configure'
script in the framework directory.

    $ ./configure

If there were no errors, then run 'make'.

    $ make

The 'make' process will take a while and will build the framework and submodules.
When this process is complete, the executables will be located in the "tools" directory
and the module libraries will be located in the "runtime" directory.  
To install them, type 'make install'.

    $ make install

By default, this will copy everything in to the /usr/local/ structure.
So, the executables will be in '/usr/local/bin'.  This directory will
need to be in your PATH if you want to run the TSK framework commands without 
specifying '/usr/local/bin' everytime.


If you get an error like:

  libtool: Version mismatch error.  This is libtool 2.2.10, but the
  libtool: definition of this LT_INIT comes from libtool 2.2.4.
  libtool: You should recreate aclocal.m4 with macros from libtool 2.2.10
  libtool: and run autoconf again.

Run:
    ./bootstrap 

and then go back to running configure and make.  To run 'bootstrap',
you'll need to have the autotools installed (see the list at the
top of this page).


CONFIGURE OPTIONS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The framework doesn't support extra arguments to 'configure'
