This file describes how to build TSK using Visual Studio.  If you do not have a copy of Visual Studio, you can use the free Express Edition:

http://www.microsoft.com/express/vc/

The Visual Studio files require that libewf exist and be compiled.   The steps below include that process.

1) Download latest libewf from:
https://www.uitwisselplatform.nl/projects/libewf/

2) Open, rename directory from libewf-200XXXX to libewf, and move libewf to the win32 subdirectory.  For example, the result should be something like: sleuthkit-3.0.0\win32\libewf.

3) Follow the README instructions in libewf to build libewf_dll (at the time of this writing, that includes downloading the zlib dll). Note that TSK will use both the Debug and Release versions of libewf, depending on the current build type of TSK. So, you may want to build both versions of libewf_dll at the same time. 
4) You will need to add to Preprocessor defines to libewf_dll.  To do so, open libewf in Visual Studio and right click on the libewf_dll project to open its properties.  Configuration Properties-> C/C++ -> Preprocessor -> Preprocessor Defines.  Add the following two to both the debug and release versions:

HAVE_WIDE_CHARACTER_SUPPORT_FUNCTIONS
HAVE_WIDE_CHARACTER_TYPE

Rebuild the dll after adding these options.

5) Open the TSK Visual Studio Solution file in the win32 directory. 

6) Compile a Debug or Release version of the libraries or executables. 

7) Note that the libraries and executables will depend on the libewf and zlib dll files (which are located in libewf/msvscpp/release (or debug) and libewf/msvscpp/zlib).
