This file describes how to build TSK using Visual Studio (see README_win32.txt for instructions on building the win32 libraries and executables from Linux).  If you do not have a copy of Visual Studio, you can use the free Express Edition:

    http://www.microsoft.com/express/vc/

The Visual Studio Solution file has three build targets: Debug, Debug_NoLibs, and Release.  Debug and Release require that libewf exist and be compiled (libewf provides support for E01 image files).   Debug_NoLibs does not require libewf and you should be able to compile Debug_NoLibs without any additional setup.

The steps below outline the process required to compile the Debug and Release targets.

1) Download libewf-20091128 or later from:
    http://sourceforge.net/projects/libewf/

2) Open archive file and follow the README instructions in libewf to build libewf_dll (at the time of this writing, that includes downloading the zlib dll). Note that TSK will use only the Release version of libewf_dll.

3) Set the LIBEWF_HOME environment variable to point to the libewf folder that you created and built in step 2. 

4) Open the TSK Visual Studio Solution file in the win32 directory. 

5) Compile a Debug or Release version of the libraries or executables. 

6) Note that the libraries and executables will depend on the libewf and zlib dll files (which are located in libewf/msvscpp/release  and libewf/msvscpp/zlib).
