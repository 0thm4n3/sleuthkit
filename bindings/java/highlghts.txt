Highlights:

- Interpretation of the file path supplied when opening a hash database now occurs
in in tsk_hdb_open(). Path strings are not swapped - the database path is written once and then not changed.
- TODO: Explain inheritance and options.
- It is no longer possible to create duplicate rows in the comment and file_names tables in SQLite hash databases.
- The "last id" business has been removed from the SQLite hash database implementation. 
- Fixed size arrays for paths are not used in the JNI code.
